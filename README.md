# Tola Activity

**The build status of the dev branch is: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mercycorps/TolaActivity.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/mercycorps/TolaActivity)**

[TolaActivity](http://www.github.com/toladata/TolaActivity) extends
the functionality of [TolaData](https://www.toladata.com/) to include a
set of forms and reports for managing project activities for a Program. It
includes workflow for approving and completing projects as well as sharing
the output data. TolaActivity functionality is intended to allow importing
and exporting of project-specific data from 3rd party data sources or
excel files.

# Creating a local TolaActivity instance

Running a local instance of TolaActivity makes development much faster and
eliminates your dependence on access to any of MC's TolaActivity instances.
These instructions should get you up and running with a minimum of fuss if
you have [macOS](#macos) or one of the many [Ubunten](#ubuntu). If they do
not, we accept pull requests updating it. :)

Through all of these instructions, it is __very important__ that a plain-text editor is used to edit the text files.
For instance, TextEdit or Notepad are fine, MS Word is emphatically not.  Even some plain-text editors default 
to a rich text format, so make sure you are saving plain text.

## Install software dependencies

TolaActivity requires Python 2. These instructions assume MySQL is being used as Django's datastore.

### macOS

On macOS, you can use Homebrew to install much of the software needed for TolaActivity.  
To see if you have Homebrew installed, run `which brew` at the command line.  If you don't get a file path, 
it is not installed and you should run the following command from the command line.
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Before starting the install process, you may also want to request a copy of the _settings.secret.yml_ file and 
a dump of an existing TolaActivity database. 


At the Terminal command line:
```bash
$ brew install python@2
$ brew install mysql@5.7
```

Add these lines to ~/.bash_profile (you may need to create it)
```text
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/:$LIBRARY_PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH"

export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/include"
```

Back at the command line:
```bash
$ source ~/.bash_profile
$ brew install mysql-utilities
$ brew install py2cairo pango
$ pip install virtualenv
```

You should now also start the mysql server:
```bash
brew services start mysql
```

Now you're ready to [install and configure the source files](#Install the source files).


### Windows
For Windows installations, install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) using a Ubuntu distribution as the base.  Once this has successfully been installed, launch a Powershell window and proceed with the Ubuntu instructions below. 


### Ubuntu

First check what python version you have installed.  Try these commands:
```bash
$ python --version
$ python2 --version
```

If neither of those yield a Python 2 installation, you will need to install Python 2:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python
```

Now if you try `python --version`, it should be pointed at Python 2.  Assuming it is, install some additional packages.

```bash
$ sudo apt install mysql-server libmysqld-dev mysql-utilities mysql-client
$ sudo apt install libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev libffi-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libpango1.0-dev
$ sudo apt install virtualenv
```

You should now also start the mysql server:
```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

Now you're ready to [install and configure the source files](#Install the source files).


##Install and configure the TolaActivity source files

###Install the source files and the python libraries
All operating systems should now be ready to install TolaActivity source files and do some OS-independent installations.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mercycorps/TolaActivity.git
$ cd TolaActivity
$ virtualenv -p python2 --no-site-packages venv
$ source venv/bin/activate  # you should see '(venv)' appear on the left of your command prompt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
```

###Modify the config file
If you have a copy of the _settings.secret.yml_ file, place it in the TolaActivity/config 
directory.  In Windows, you will need to copy it from where the file is stored on your hard drive.  You may want to modify the file per the instructions below (not with an MS Office product!) before moving it to the TolaActivity folder.  To move the file, f the file is in your Downloads directory, you could use a command that looks something like this:
```bash
$ cp /mnt/c/Users/<your_username>/Downloads/settings.secret.yml config
```

If you don't have a copy of the settings.secret.py file, then copy the sample file thusly:
``` 
$ cp config/sample-settings.secret.yml config/settings.secret.yml
```


Open the _config/settings.secret.yml_ file with a plain-text editor.
 
1. Find the node named, "DATABASES" and set the
database `PASSWORD` as appropriate. The result should resemble the following:

    ```yaml
    DATABASES:
      default:
        ENGINE: "django.db.backends.mysql"
        NAME: "tola_activity"
        USER: "tola"
        PASSWORD: "SooperSekritWord"
        HOST: "localhost"
        PORT: ""
    ```

    The rest of the instructions assume that you've used the values above.

1. Modify the LOGFILE entry so it points to a file in the _logs_ directory you just created.
    For example:

    ```yaml
    LOGFILE: '/User/<username>/logs/django_error.log'
    ```

1. If they don't already exist, add the two lines below.  These let Django know which webpack bundles to use.
    ```yaml
    WEBPACK_STATS_FILE: 'webpack-stats.json'
    WEBPACK_BUNDLE_DIR_NAME: 'dist/'
    ```


## Create the log directory

```bash
$ mkdir /User/<username>/logs
```    

## Set up Django's MySQL backing store
Log into mysql and create the database, create the user, and grant permissions. 
```sql
$ mysql -u root  # Ubuntu users will need to use sudo for this line
mysql> CREATE DATABASE tola_activity;
mysql> CREATE USER 'tola'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'SooperSekritWord';
mysql> GRANT ALL ON tola_activity.* TO 'tola'@'localhost';
mysql> exit

```

## Set up Django

If you have a copy of an existing Tola database, you can load through the mysql command.  When prompted, you should provide the database password (SooperSekritWord).
```bash
$ mysql -u tola -p tola_activity < /path/to/file.sql
```
Run the database migrations, even if you just uploaded the .sql file.

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### If you get an error during migration

During migration, you might see an error like the following:

```bash
Applying social_django.0005_auto_20160727_2333
  django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1071, 'Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes')
```

The *social_django* app creates a *unique_together* relationship between two rows that concatenate
to a value too long for the destination row. To fix this, manually change the following two fields:

* social_auth_association.server_url to varchar(100)
* social_auth_association.handle to varchar(100)

You can address this through the MySQL CLI:

```bash
$ mysql -u tola -p tola_activity  # you will be prompted for the database password
mysql> ALTER TABLE social_auth_association MODIFY server_url varchar(100) NOT NULL;
mysql> ALTER TABLE social_auth_association MODIFY handle varchar(100) NOT NULL;
mysql> exit
```

...then re-run the migration as normal:

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```


Start the server:

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver

Django version 1.11.2, using settings 'tola.settings.local'
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

## Try launching Tola in your browser
In your browser, navigate to `localhost:8000`.  You should see a TolaActivity login screen.  You should also be able
login through the Google+ link. 

## Creating a local user

If you are not logging in through the Google+ link, you will need to create a local user so you can log in.
The following commands will create a local superuser and add the additional data that is required.
When the `createsuperuser` command asks for an email, you can just hit the Enter key to skip the question.

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
Username: myname
Email address: 
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.

``` 

Now get the id of the record you just added to the auth.user table:

```bash
$ mysql -u tola -p tola_activity
mysql> SELECT id,username FROM auth_user;
+----+----------+
| id | username |
+----+----------+
|  1 | myname    |
+----+----------+
```

Note the value for `id` to use in the next step.

Insert the `id` value from the `auth_user` table into the `user_id` field of the `workflow_tolauser` table:

```bash
mysql> INSERT INTO workflow_tolauser (name, privacy_disclaimer_accepted, user_id, language) VALUES ("My Name", 1,1, "en");
mysql> exit
```

Restart the Tola Activity server

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver

Django version 1.11.2, using settings 'tola.settings.local'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

You should now be able to login using the username and password fields of the login screen.  Once you have logged in,
you will be taken to the home page. 


# For Developers

## Front-end development setup and dev server

Tola uses Webpack and `npm` installed packages in `node_modules` to build javascript bundles.
During development, you will need to run the webpack development server to have the latest JS
bundles available, and to re-generate the bundles if you modify any JS handled by Webpack.

Directions for installing `npm` can be found below. It can also be installed via homebrew on macOS

```bash
$ brew install npm
```

### Install all `node_module` package dependencies using `npm`

```bash
$ npm install
```

Note: You made need to periodiclly run this after doing a `git pull` if `package.json` has been
updated with new dependencies. This is similar to running `pip install -r requements.txt` if
the `requirements.txt` has been updated.

### Start the webpack development server

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

This should be done along side `./manage.py runserver`

### Run JS unit tests

```bash
$ npm test
```

It's also possible to run the tests in "watch" mode

```bash
$ npm test -- --watch
```
or
```bash
$ npm run test:watch
```

### Build bundles for production

When you are ready to deploy to an external server, you will need to build and check-in the
production ready bundles. These are generated with:

```bash
$ npm run build:prod
```

or use the alias

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Installing and running the front-end harness

*See also the [front-end architecture roadmap](https://github.com/mercycorps/TolaActivity/wiki/Proposal-for-front-end-architecture).*

This is *optional* if you are not doing significant front-end development. You can bypass the frontend build by dropping selectors into `/path/to/project/tola/static/css/app.css`.

### Installation & Startup:

1. Globally install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). Here are [general instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#install-npm--manage-npm-versions) to do so. On my Mac I prefer to install it via [Homebrew](https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew)
2. Install local dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ cd /path/to/project/
    $ npm install
    ```
    This will install all necessary node modules into `node_modules` at the project root.
3. Start a watch task that will copy necessary libraries and compile static files while you work:
    ```bash
    $ cd /path/to/project/
    $ npm start
    ```
    You can also configure PyCharm to run this task in the background:
    1. Select __Run__ → __Edit Configurations...__
    2. __Add new configuration__ (__⌘-n__ or click the __+__ button)
    3. Choose __npm__ in the wee popup
    4. PyCharm should automagically select the correct __package.json__: `/path/to/project/package.json`
    5. Choose the __Command__ `start`

npm will compile a single global css file at `/path/to/project/tola/static/css/tola.css`. This file includes the entire Bootstrap library (previously in `bootstrap.min.css` and `bootstrap-multiselect.min.css`), our custom selectors (previously in `app.css`), and overrides to Bootstrap (previously in `bootstrap_overrides.css`)



### Other tips:

1. __Never edit the compiled css (`tola.css`) directly.__ Any manual changes to compiled css files will be overwritten the next time the css is regenerated. They are theoretically retrievable via Git but see #3, below. Remember: you can always bypass the harness by dropping css selectors directly into `app.css`.

2. But seriously, you should just put your css into a .scss file & compile it properly. __Valid css is also valid scss.__ If you’re not sure where to write a selector, append it to the __end__ of the master scss file: `/path/to/project/scss/tola.scss`.

3. Please commit your compiled css to GitHub, preferably in the same commit as your edits to our scss files.

4. There is no need to resolve merge conflicts in compiled css. Resolve them in the scss files first, then regenerate your css and accept all changes from the right (HEAD) side.

5. Suggestions for Frontend coding practices are forthcoming.
